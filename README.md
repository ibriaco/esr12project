**MSCA ITN Early Language Development in The Digital Age (e-LADDA)**

Modern digital technologies are transforming rapidly the environment in which children are growing up and developing skills. This new digital reality has both changed the nature of the linguistic input provided to young children, but also affords new ways of interaction with communication agents, such as tablets and robots.

The goal of e-LADDA is to establish whether the new and intuitive interactions afforded by digital tools impact on young childrenâ€™s language development and language outcomes in a positive or adverse way. We further aim to identify exactly what factors in both the technology itself and the communication channel advance language learning and growth or may impede it.

This goal will be pursued in e-LADDA from a highly interdisciplinary and cross-sectorial perspective, bridging between research disciplines and methodologies and in collaboration with industry and the non-academic public sector.

This project aims to develop a new smartphone/tablet app, based on the latest Augmented Reality (AR) developed by SpongeUK, to teach language concepts to autistic children in natural environments. Both pictograms and words will be included in the design. Experiments will be conducted to validate the app, the feasibility of its use to teach vocabulary in real-life settings, and its benefits on learning outcomes.
